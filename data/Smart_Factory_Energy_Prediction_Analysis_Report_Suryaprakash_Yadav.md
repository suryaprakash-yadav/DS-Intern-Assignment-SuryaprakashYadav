Smart Factory Energy Prediction - Report by Suryaprakash Yadav

1. My Approach to the Problem Statement :-
The goal of this problem was to develop an effective machine learning model to predict the energy consumption of factory equipment based on environmental factors and sensor readings from various zones in the factory. Accurate energy predictions are crucial for optimizing energy usage, reducing operational costs, and enhancing sustainability in factory settings.This hiring challenge provided an opportunity to apply data science techniques in a real-world scenario, emphasizing problem-solving, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

My approach involved the following key steps:-
a) Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
I started with handling missing values and preprocessing the data to ensure that the dataset was clean and suitable for modeling. This included encoding categorical variables and scaling continuous features to standardize the data for the models.

b) Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering was a critical step, where I generated polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships between the environmental conditions and the energy consumption. This expanded the feature space and allowed me to model more complex interactions.

c) Model Selection & Tuning:
I experimented with multiple models, including Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost. I used RandomizedSearchCV to efficiently perform hyperparameter tuning, selecting the best parameters for optimal model performance. The combination of Random Forest and XGBoost in an ensemble model was also evaluated to enhance prediction accuracy.

d) Model Evaluation:
To assess the model's performance, I utilized a range of evaluation metrics, including RMSE, MAE, and R². These metrics allowed me to compare different models and gauge their effectiveness in predicting energy consumption on unseen data.

2. Key Insights from the Data :-
The data provided valuable insights into factors that significantly influence energy consumption in the factory:

a) Correlation with Energy Consumption:
I identified several features that showed strong correlations with energy consumption, including temperature, humidity, and equipment usage. These factors were pivotal in understanding the dynamics of energy consumption, making them crucial for building effective predictive models.

b) Handling Missing Data:
Missing data was prevalent across several columns. I addressed this by imputing missing values with the mean for numerical variables and using 'unknown' placeholders for categorical variables like temperature and humidity, ensuring that the model wasn't biased or skewed by missing information.

c) Polynomial Feature Expansion:
Polynomial feature expansion was applied to enhance the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships between the input features and energy consumption. This technique proved effective in boosting the model's performance by incorporating higher-order interactions.

These insights underline the importance of closely monitoring environmental factors and equipment usage in optimizing energy consumption in industrial settings.

3. Model Performance Evaluation:-
The evaluation of model performance is a critical aspect of this project, as it enables me to measure the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. To ensure a comprehensive assessment, I utilized key performance metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 (Coefficient of Determination). Below are the detailed results for each model:

a) Random Forest Regressor:
RMSE: 0.5271

MAE: 0.3446

R²: 0.4505

The Random Forest Regressor model performed reasonably well, with a solid R2 score indicating that the model explained approximately 45% of the variance in energy consumption. While the performance is acceptable, there is still room for improvement, especially in reducing prediction errors.

b) XGBoost:
RMSE: 0.5462

MAE: 0.3636

R²: 0.4100

The XGBoost model, though competitive, showed slightly higher RMSE and MAE values compared to Random Forest. This suggests that while XGBoost captured some patterns in the data, it struggled slightly more with error minimization compared to Random Forest.

c) Ensemble Model (Random Forest + XGBoost):
RMSE: 0.5253

MAE: 0.3418

R²: 0.4542

The Ensemble Model, which combines the predictions of both the Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost, outperformed the individual models across all key metrics. By averaging the strengths of both models, the Ensemble achieved the best performance with the lowest RMSE (0.5253), the lowest MAE (0.3418), and the highest R² (0.4542). This demonstrates that ensemble techniques can significantly enhance predictive accuracy, leveraging the complementary strengths of different models to improve overall performance.

>> Key Takeaways:- 
a) The Ensemble Model was the clear winner, showing superior performance across all metrics.

b) Combining multiple models can help address the weaknesses of individual models, especially in high-dimensional, complex datasets like the one used in this project.

c) The use of ensemble techniques demonstrates advanced skills in model optimization and highlights the importance of model selection for accurate predictions.

4. Recommendations for Reducing Equipment Energy Consumption:-
Based on the data and model findings, the following actionable recommendations can help reduce energy consumption in the factory:

a) Optimize Temperature and Humidity Control:
Temperature and humidity were found to have a significant impact on energy consumption. By continuously monitoring and adjusting these factors, factories can reduce unnecessary energy consumption, especially during periods of high equipment usage.

b)  Equipment Scheduling:
By analyzing the usage patterns of energy-intensive equipment, I can recommend an optimal scheduling strategy to operate high-energy-consuming equipment during off-peak hours or when energy demand is low, leading to better energy efficiency.

c) Predictive Maintenance:
My predictive model can be extended to predict equipment failure or underperformance based on sensor data. Timely maintenance can help prevent energy wastage caused by malfunctioning equipment, contributing to overall energy savings.

d) IoT-Based Automated Energy Management:
Implementing an IoT-based energy management system that adjusts equipment settings based on real-time data from sensors would allow the factory to automatically fine-tune energy usage for optimal performance, without manual intervention.

5. Future Work:-
While the current model has provided valuable insights and a solid foundation for energy consumption prediction, there are several areas for future work:

a) Real-Time Data Integration:
By integrating real-time sensor data from the factory’s equipment, the model could dynamically update energy consumption forecasts. This would allow for more immediate responses to fluctuating energy needs, helping the factory become more energy-efficient.

b) Cost Optimization:
Expanding the model to predict energy costs based on usage patterns and energy prices would provide a comprehensive solution for not only minimizing energy consumption but also managing operational costs effectively.

c) Full-Scale Energy Management System:
In the future, integrating the predictive models into a complete Energy Management System (EMS) could help automate energy-saving measures across the entire factory, improving both sustainability and cost-efficiency.

6. Conclusion:-
This hiring challenge has successfully demonstrated the potential of machine learning in predicting factory energy consumption, offering valuable insights into the environmental factors and equipment usage patterns that influence energy use. By applying models such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and leveraging an ensemble approach, I have developed a solution that can help factories optimize energy consumption and reduce operational costs. The insights and recommendations provided can serve as a basis for implementing real-world solutions aimed at improving energy efficiency and sustainability in industrial environments.
